jangaroo-maven-repository-archive
=================================
We use this GitHub repo's gh-pages to serve the old Jangaroo Maven repository http://repo.jangaroo.net/maven2.

Since version 0.8.0, all Jangaroo releases are deployed to Maven central,
so the repository is only needed if you use really really old Jangaroo versions.
